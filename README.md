🐍 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge 🐍 Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey, where I’m diving into Python programming every day for 100 days! 🚀

📅 Challenge Timeline Start Date: 26 Oct. 2024 Goal: Commit to coding in Python daily for 100 days, focusing on both foundational concepts and real-world projects. Each day is a new step forward, aiming to build a strong Python foundation and work on hands-on projects along the way!

🌟 Objectives Learn Core Python Concepts: Variables, data types, control structures, functions, and modules. Build Small Projects: Simple games, data processing scripts, and utilities. Explore Libraries & Frameworks: Get hands-on experience with essential libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter). Document Daily Progress: Share learnings, challenges, and solutions to track growth over time. 📚 Topics Covered Each day covers new Python topics, including but not limited to:

Basics: Variables, conditionals, loops Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) File Handling Web Scraping Data Visualization APIs Machine Learning Basics (if time allows)
